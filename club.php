            <p style="font-size: large;">GreFC was born from the passion of a small group of University of Greenwich students who began playing together as a small football team in 2018. What started as casual kickabouts soon grew into a more organised and competitive group, driven by a shared love for the game.
                <br><br>

                In 2021, GreFC was officially recognised as a club under the University of Greenwich, marking the start of a new chapter where we could represent the university, attract more members, and strengthen our football community.
                <br><br>

                Built on three core principles — excellence in sport, inclusivity for all skill levels, and building lasting friendships — our club remains committed to providing a welcoming environment for everyone.
                <br><br>

                From just 12 founding members, GreFC has grown into one of the most successful and respected clubs at the University of Greenwich, competing in the university league and fostering a strong sense of belonging on and off the pitch.
